'Computer programming for beginners. Very little prior knowledge regarding how computers work is assumed. Learn how to write understandable computer programs in a programming language widely used on the Internet. Go beyond the routine skills of a computer user and learn the programming fundamentals: data, variables, selection, loops, arrays, input-output, methods and parameter passing, object and classes, abstraction. Take what is learned and write programs for use on the Internet. One hour per week of the course is a required laboratory.',
